<p class="text">Challenge</p>
<p class="subtext">At the time, all keyboards were created equal in terms of functionality. There was only a specified set of emojis that can be used globally between apps and messengers. No one had yet thought about making keyboards do more.</p>
<p class="text">Solution</p>
<p class="subtext">Utilizing MMS technology, Sharemoji allowed for custom emojis to be sent and recieved by "baking" them into your messages. The keyboard also included never-before seen features, like text filters that scrambled messages before they were sent.</p>
<p class="text">ROI</p>
<p class="subtext">Sharemoji trail-blazed the advancement of keyboard capabilities, opening up the genre for more keyboard app companies to follow suit. Sharemoji was eventiually turned into Kimoji (Kim Kardashian's keyboard), which went on to "break" the App Store upon its release! </p>
