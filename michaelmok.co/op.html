<p class="text">Challenge</p>
<p class="subtext">The typical education loan process consists of a long and confusing application averaging multiple days to complete from start to finish. Many loan origination platforms rely on manual processes and old technology.</p>
<p class="text">Solution</p>
<p class="subtext">Implement the latest and greatest design practices and technology to create a slick, easy to understand application for the front-end and a dynamic "live" customer service portal for instant processing on the back-end.</p>
<p class="text">ROI</p>
<p class="subtext">Using conversational UI and technologies including Google Places API, active credit pulling, credit report parsing and JIRA as a customer service portal, the loan process was reduced to a single 20-minute user session.</p>
